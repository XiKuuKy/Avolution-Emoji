`Avolution.P6`
===============

`Avolution.P6` is a Perl6 module for using emoji. It substitutes `:text:` for emojis! You can find codes [here](https://www.webfx.com/tools/emoji-cheat-sheet/) but note that not all are implemented and certain emoji on this list may never be implemented like `:bowtie:` because they are not in the unicode standard. Also note that the `_` isn't required in the codes and won't work, you have to use `-`.
